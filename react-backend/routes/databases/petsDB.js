This high energy pup needs plenty of outlets to keep him physically and mentally stimulated throughout the day.\n\nHe was previously in a foster home where he was getting taken to the dog park twice a day to run around to play! According to his foster, he is great at dog parks and with people and kids. (He's not a fan of cats though!) Although he is great at the dog run and loves playing with other dogs of all sizes off leash, Bella gets very frustrated when on leash and can be reactive if he sees another dog. He should not meet other dogs while on leash due to his frustration and because of this, he would benefit from being in a quieter neighborhood with little dog foot-traffic. Otherwise he is an affectionate, intelligent, and motivated boy who knows his basic commands and some tricks!\n\nBella's ideal home has someone around most of the time - he loves his people! He'll need someone willing to work on his leash training and is okay about him not meeting other dogs on leash for the time being. If you're interested in adopting Bella please contact Animal Haven directly for more information!"

I'm an 18-month-old Beagle/Lab mix who loves snuggling just as much as walks, hikes, and romping through the snow! I'm housebroken, crate trained, and can sit and lay down when asked... super smart and receptive to learning new things! I'm still a bit timid and am easily spooked by loud sounds and sometimes humans if they move quickly (this looks like getting really small and trying to hide), but getting more and more used to the people and noises of the city. I LOVE saying hi to dogs when we're on walks, so much so that I get a little whiny when I can't greet everyone... working on that. I'm totally well-behaved when I do get to sniff another pup, and I get along just fine with my foster fam's cat! I really like to be around my trusted humans, which includes following someone around the apartment, and crying for a minute or two when they go out on errands, before settling down in my crate quite quickly. Can't wait to show off my sweet, cuddly, playful self with my forever fam!\n\nWhat is a Beagle?: A beagle is in fact a type of hound and super scent oriented. They have a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts. Fun fact, beagles are the primary breed used as detection dogs for prohibited agriculture. The breed's most famous representative is the world's very beloved cartoon character Snoopy! Beagles are very popular family dogs because they are known to be sweet and easy to train. (On a sad note, they are commonly used in testing labs because they are so trusting and docile, and there are many rescues specifically dedicated to saving beagles from the chemical testing world.)"

I've never met a dog that sleeps so late!\n\nOh Daisy!! It might just be us but.. we could stare at her face all day. She's got such a sweet face. Daisy was rescued in TN as a stray. It's clear that she had been a mom a few times over. We are excited for Daisy to now have her spotlight! Daisy is a young girl who is working on her manners, she has some puppy habits. But listens very well. She needs owners who will make her a priority and help her become the best version of herself. Her owners will need to make training a priority! Daisy is a Medium active girl. But she might become a higher active girl once she feels really comfy. She's the type of pup that knows how to chill indoors but really needs that long midday walk to keep her happy and funky and fresh. Daisy would do great in a home with another dog and in a queit neighborhood. She would be happiest in an adults only home. Interested in adopting?

I'm an 18-month-old Beagle/Lab mix who loves snuggling just as much as walks, hikes, and romping through the snow! I'm housebroken, crate trained, and can sit and lay down when asked... super smart and receptive to learning new things! I'm still a bit timid and am easily spooked by loud sounds and sometimes humans if they move quickly (this looks like getting really small and trying to hide), but getting more and more used to the people and noises of the city. I LOVE saying hi to dogs when we're on walks, so much so that I get a little whiny when I can't greet everyone... working on that. I'm totally well-behaved when I do get to sniff another pup, and I get along just fine with my foster fam's cat! I really like to be around my trusted humans, which includes following someone around the apartment, and crying for a minute or two when they go out on errands, before settling down in my crate quite quickly. Can't wait to show off my sweet, cuddly, playful self with my forever fam!\n\n"

Bentley is house trained and well behaved when left alone at home. She is very eager to please and would suit an experienced family that is willing to give her love, trust and some structured training. Bentley loves going out for walks and playing with other dogs of similar sizes. Bentley can get over excited with other dogs after extended play so would likely be suited to a house where she is the only dog. She is getting better on a leash but will need further training. She needs to be with an active family that has a yard for her to run around in and is committed to taking her out for walks as she loves exploring the neighborhood. Bentley is a beautiful dog that would make for the great family companion."

The vet said I was all good and to just relax and start getting used to my new indoor environment. It took me some time to get used to being around humans and even made a couple friends with other cats in their home. All seemed to be good and then “bam”, I fell out of a window and was back out in the streets. Oh no, not back out there again!\n\nI found a place by the train tracks underneath a broken down car. After 21 days, a bunch of friendly neighborhood people caught me again … who knew there were so many people looking out for me. I am back with my foster parents and my cat friends with a full tummy.\n\nI think I am ready to find a family who can see that my sad face is really a happy face. I am a humble, calm boy and my foster parents are telling me I will be ok and that I will one day find my forever home.\n\nIf you are an experienced adopter, can give me some patience and space to get comfortable in your home, I would love to meet you.\n\nSend me some positive energy and let me know it will all be ok.\n\nLove,\n\nZeus"

Lucky for Winston, someone stepped up and kept him until rescue placement could be secured.\n\n2 weeks later, AARR took Winston into their care. Winston was vet checked and neutered and overall got a good bill of health.\n\nMarshmallow is a Californian rabbit. As you can see he is extremely handsome and photogenic. He is a sweet, curious boy, but a little shy. He doesn't understand all these changes but now he is safe with AARR. He likes to hop around, explore, and give you a few nudges.

Thankfully there was space and after having a mani/pedi and a wonderful brush out I was back to feeling like my old self. I have now been spayed and am a very friendly girl however I do have a condition that certain buns suffer from called Megacolon. There is a condition I was born with and nothing surgery or medicine can correct. Basically its a irregularity of my bowels which causes my droppings to be more of a cow pile consistency than a hard round shaped ball. Because of this I dont need much extra care but it does at times cause my litterbox habits to be a little less than other buns that do not have the condition. A more experienced adopter would be ideal for me because of the above. I only weigh 2 lbs and am full grown.\n\nI am eating a proper diet of Oxbow timothy pellets, timothy hay and fresh water plus to keep me hydrated my foster mom does mix up some critical care and water for me a few times a week.\n\nWould you consider giving a sweet girl like me a home of my own?"
