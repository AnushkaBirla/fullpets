# Welcome to PetsGalore! 

This is a pet adoption website I made as a project! You can filter for pets available for adoption near you, by animal type, breed, and their maximium age.

Made with React (and love)

# Instructions

- Clone the repo
- cd into the my-app folder (this is the frontend) and npm start
- In another terminal tab, cd into the react-backend folder (this is the backend) and "PORT=3001 npm start" (on mac). For windows: "set PORT=3001 &&  node bin/www"
- Go to localhost:3000 and you should see the application!
